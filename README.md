# QUICK START GUIDE
Step-by-step instructions to run the analysis


## INITIAL SETTINGS
### Download R and RStudio

Ensure that you have R version 4.4.1 or higher installed on your computer. The necessary software for this analysis can be found at:
* R:  https://cran.r-project.org/
* RStudio:  https://posit.co/downloads/
* Rtools:  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html

### Open R project
* On your computer, navigate to your working directory that contains the R project and initial files. Then, click on the R project named  _KoalaModellingAnalysis.Rproj_.
* Navigate to  _File_,  click  _Open fileâ€¦_,  go to the code folder within your working directory, select  _setup_script.R_,  and click _Open_. Once the script is open, click _Source_ (near the top right corner of the script panel) to download the latest code from GitHub (https://github.com/seq-koala-monitoring/stats-model/tree/main) and configure the working directory to ensure that the analyses run properly.

### Parameters
We designed this project to give users flexibility to adjust parameters while still achieving reliable results. If you need to modify any spatial parameter from the default, adjust the arguments in the _parameters_init.txt_ file.
The parameters are:
* primary_grid_size: A numeric value representing the spatial dimensions (in metres) of each cell in the analysis and mapping grid.
    `primary_grid_size <- 500`
* secondary_grid_multiple: A numeric value that multiplies the primary grid size to create a coarser secondary grid.
    `secondary_grid_multiple <- 10`
* line_transect_buffer: A numeric value (in metres) for the estimated width of line transects (i.e., one side from the line transect).
    `line_transect_buffer <- 28.7`
* cov_impute_buffer: A numeric value (in metres) for the buffer around areas for covariate imputation.
    `cov_impute_buffer <- 0`
* area_buffer: A numeric value (in metres) defining the buffer around the study area.
    `area_buffer <- 0`
* genetic_units: The filename (with extension and within quotation marks) of the spatial layer containing boundaries of genetic populations.
    `genetic_units <- "Population_boundaries_v2.shp"`
* gen_pop_column_id: A string (within quotation marks) specifying the column name that identifies each genetic unit in the spatial layer.
    `gen_pop_column_id <- "GENPOP_ID"`
* whether to aggregate the genetic population into three regions or not
    `gen_pop_agg <- TRUE`
* update_database: Should the koala survey database be updated with new data?
    * This integrates new survey data into the modelling database by performing data integrity checks, matching the Site_ID with the spatial locations of survey sites, assigning a genetic unit (i.e., "genetic" population), estimating missing perpendicular distances, and formatting the data to meet modelling requirements. Optionally, the function can also incorporate the spatial representation of the new surveys into the existing spatial file containing all koala surveys (default is TRUE).
    `update_database <- TRUE`
* specifies whether to run data processing in parallel (requires RStudio API if true)
    `use_parallel <- TRUE`
* specify whether to run the covariate extraction algorithm; if not, read from disc in the output folder (computationally intensive, 30-minute run if TRUE)
    `run_cov_extraction <- TRUE`
* specify wheher to use spatial data imputation (default = FALSE - unlikely to be needed)
    `use_imputation <- FALSE`
* list of static predictor variables to use,
    * Variables removed by default due to high correlations (> 0.6 or < -0.6) were:
    * elevation,
    * terrain ruggedness index,
    * persistent green,
    * intensive land-use in a 2 km buffer,
    * maximum temperature,
    `static_variables <- c("htslo", "hspc1", "hspc2", "hcltp", "hcltt", "hhgde")`
* list of time dynamic predictor variables to use,
    * Variables removed by default due to high correlations (> 0.6 or < -0.6) were:
    * elevation,
    * terrain ruggedness index,
    * persistent green,
    * intensive land-use in a 2 km buffer,
    * maximum temperature,
    `dynamic_variables <- c("hhfwc", "hhpgr2km", "htpls2km", "hcpre", "hctmn", "hseas", "hhkha", "htlus")`
* list of observer error predictor variables,
    * Variables removed by default due to too much missing data were:
    * weather,
    * cloud cover,
    * wind,
    * canopy cover,
    * subcanopy cover,
    `obs_variables <- c("hhcht", "hhunf", "hhchtunf", "hdtma", "hdpre")`
* When extracting ObserverID as a predictor for observer error, should observers be grouped (from 2021 onwards)?
    * This parameter lets the user choose between two options: (1) Using each observer ID as a variable, which may result in models that are easier to converge but require long computing times; (2) Grouping observers based on their affiliation, as specified in the group_observers.csv file located in input/group_observers/. This option reduces computing time but may lead to convergence issues in the models.
    `obs_groups <- FALSE`
* set whether to mask rainforest,
    `RainMask <- TRUE`

### TERN API
You also need to provide an API code that allows R to download a few soil variables
from TERN. Please, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to https://portal.tern.org.au/browse/theme
2. Click "Sign in" in the right-hand side
3. Sign in with an account
4. Once logged in, click you name and TERN account
5. Click API Keys > Create API Keys > Type a name > Request API key
6. Copy or save the API key in a secure location
7. Open the file _apis.R_ in R or any text editor like Notepad. The file is located
within the keys folder in your working directory
8. Replace the sequence of numbers and letters with your API code. Make sure
to keep it within quotes


## COVARIATES AND KOALA SURVEY DATA
### Download covariates
The R script  _covariate_processing.R_  was designed to update the covariates required for the Bayesian state-space model used to estimate koala densities across Southeast Queensland.
The basic workflow involves opening the file in R, checking if the input folder already has the latest covariate file. If it doesn't, the code will automatically download, process, and save the most recent file to the correct location.
Before anything, start fresh by clicking Session > Restart R. After that, please select all lines by pressing Ctrl + A on a Windows PC or Command + A on a Mac. Then, run these lines by pressing Ctrl + Enter on a Windows PC or Command + Return on a Mac. Alternatively, you can click on Source near the top right corner of the script panel. This code may take anywhere from a few minutes to days to run, depending on how many files need updating and your computer's specifications.
When you see "THIS CODE HAS FINISHED" in the Console panel (usually at the bottom left), you're ready to start processing these covariates.
NOTE:
Disregard any warnings on the taskbar about packages that are not installed

### Update survey database and process data for modelling
The R script  _data_processing.R_  was designed to process all covariate data related to the survey data. It also formats the data appropriately for the Bayesian state-space model used to estimate koala densities in Southeast Queensland.
The basic workflow involves three main steps:
1.  Updating the koala survey database
2.  Extracting covariate values for the transects in the koala survey database
3.  Preparing the data for the modelling phase
In RStudio, start fresh by clicking Session > Restart R. After that, please select all lines by pressing Ctrl + A on a Windows PC or Command + A on a Mac. Then, run these lines by pressing Ctrl + Enter on a Windows PC or Command + Return on a Mac. Alternatively, you can click on Source near the top right corner of the script panel.
When you see "THIS CODE HAS FINISHED" in the Console panel (usually at the bottom left), you're ready for the modelling stage.
NOTE:
1.  Disregard any warnings on the taskbar about packages that are not installed
2.  This code may take anywhere from a few minutes to days to run, depending on how many files need updating and your computer's specifications.



## MODELLING
### Fit models
The R script _model_runs.R_ was designed to fit the Bayesian state-space model used to estimate koala densities across Southeast Queensland. The model itself is specified in file _nimble_code.R_. 
You only need to open the _model_runs.R_  file in R, select all the lines, and click run. The process will automatically load the parameters previously defined in the _parameter_init.txt_ file. 

### Make predictions
The R script _predictions.R_ was developed to estimate koala densities across the whole study area, based on relationships learned from survey data and spatial covariates. 
Once more, all you need is to open _predictions.R_, select all lines, and click Run.
